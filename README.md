# Earthquake Magnitude Prediction using ML and DL models

The objective of this project is to develop an earthquake prediction model based on the position (latitude and longitude) and depth by using various machine learning and deep learning algorithms. This method is applied for different values of the radius around the target earthquake.

## About the Dataset
The data for this research is taken from the USGS website.These datasets consist of features and magnitude values for different radius values (100, 200, 500, 1000, 1500, 3000, and 5000) around the target earthquake.

Download the Dataset from [here](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/).

The correlation matrix of the various parameters used in the dataset is shown here.

## Algorithms' Comparison
The comparison of the proposed algorithms for different radius values at a constant magnitude of 4.4 is demonstrated here.
